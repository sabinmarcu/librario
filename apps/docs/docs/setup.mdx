# Setup

:::warning Disclaimer
#### This part took... way too long ðŸ¤¦. Most of this is out of scope for the requirements, but these have been things that I've wanted to try for a while, or wanted to better on for a long time, and therefore took the time to experiment before tackling the actual requirements.

I did this while on vacation ðŸ˜…

## Repository Setup

I've worked with `Nx` in the past, as well as homebrew solutions with nothing but `yarn 3` (see [tscmono](http://github.com/sabinmarcu/tscmono)), but never really tried `turborepo`, so this is what I went with for this project. Setup-wise, it took less work than `Nx` and was way easier to customize to a flow I felt comfortable with, so I'm happy with the choice. It's still mostly `yarn 3` in the background, and with a few tweaks, I got it to work with less distributed (read: all over the place) configuration files, and have them either centralized or outright generated at install time.

Speaking of generating...

## Typescript

I chose typescript 4.9 (just released) mostly so I can start using the new `satisfies` keyword. I've also used [tscmono](http://github.com/sabinmarcu/tscmono), a tool I (partly) built a while back with the purpose of generating `tsconfig.json` files on the fly, based on presets, so I don't have to keep track of project references by hand. 

`tsconfig.json` presets are just improvements over a base `tsconfig.base.json` and can be merged into the final `tsconfig.json` file. `tscmono` is configured with `.tsconfigrc.yml` (or any of the usual `cosmiconfig` patterns), one for the root of the project (where the presets are defined), and one for each package (where the presets are merged into the final `tsconfig.json` file).

:::note
VSCode language server for JSON/XML files supports a `schema` option in a comment at the top of the line, and, since I generate my types and validators for these configs from a JSON schema, that first line on each config file is a link to the schema file, so that the editor can provide auto-completion and validation.
:::

I'm also generating a `tsconfig.build.json`, which excludes all test files from building. That enables the base `tsconfig.json` to be used for the editor, and the `tsconfig.build.json` for `tsc -b <file>` or a similar flow.

Granted, for this project, with no independent builds (for the most part) and no independent publishing of packages (which would require independent builds), it's not that necessary. However, it made integrating `eslint` a lot easier.

Speaking of which...

## ESLint

I went with a completely custom eslint config which I've been iterating on for the past few projects ([my Nx experiment](https://github.com/sabinmarcu/website-helium) being one of them, and [an electron experiment](https://github.com/sabinmarcu/vy)). 

Some plugins/addons that I've used are:

------------------
| Addon | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `eslint-plugin-expect-type` | Writing tests for types. <br /> Check any `.type.spec.ts` file |
| `eslint-plugin-modules-newlines` | Force all `import { ... } from '...'` to have all elements on a new line |
| `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` | Allow eslint to resolve `exports: { ... }` fields in `package.json` files |
| `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-assertions` | Allow `import` statements to have `assert` fields in `.mjs` files |

I've also built the config into small chunks, each treating a different subset of possible combinations (`.js` files extend `airbnb-base` and `.jsx` files extend `airbnb`, etc.)

For more info, check out the [eslint config](https://github.com/sabinmarcu/librario/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-custom) itself.

:::success Note
This will definitely become an npm package really soon. I really like how it turned out, how flexible it is, and the fact that I brought it to the point where I can drop it into any of my projects and easily integrate it.

:::info Types Testing
I wanted to take one second to talk about type testing because I like the concept. Turns out, some really smart people have figured out that we can easily use `eslint` with the `@typescript-eslint/parser` to write out "unit" tests for types. For example, we could have: 

```
type Test = { a: string; b: number; c: boolean; };

type Test2 = Test;
//    ^? { a: string; b: number; c: boolean; }
// 
//            <eslint will fill in the type, 
//           and it acts as an inline snapshot>

declare const test: Test;

// $ExpectError
const x: string = test.b;
// 
// <eslint will detect that this isn't right, and the
//   test will technically succeed since we're expecting
//    it to error out>
```

In my case, this sort of type testing is enabled in `*.type.spec.ts` files, ignored by tests, builds, etc.

Speaking of testing...

## Jest

First off, we all know what `jest` is. Currently, it's configured with `jest projects` and `ts-jest` for running only `TS/TSX` extensions. 

Where I had fun with this was: 
- writing the reusable configs as a generator with `.mjs` extensions
- integrating `wallaby` more directly (`wallaby.js` file in root) since it didn't want to cooperate from the very beginning.

Speaking of testing but in another way...

## Storybook

Storybook has been implemented as a separate app within the `apps` (not that the location matters) folder. It's the basic storybook setup, only that it is configured to retrieve stories from any package of the repository.

:::warning Bug
The `react-docgen-typescript` plugin doesn't seem to be working right with either: 
- vite
- monorepo 
- these specific versions of the packages
- any combination of the above

Either way, generating controls for a story based on types doesn't seem to work, for now.
:::

:::info
As we all know, stories can be used in unit tests, so I'm looking forward to trying that out. I'm hoping using a story as a fixture for unit testing in `jest/cypress` (maybe, at the end) will be more fun than rendering a component in a test and checking if it has the right text (for example)

And speaking of visuals...

## Docusaurus

I've used docusaurus before, and I've always liked it. It's a great tool for documentation, and it's easy to use. Therefore, it was a no-brainer to use it for this project as a devlog of sorts. A place for me to write down how I set things up, and why, for later reflection, and inspiration, as [described earlier](./intro).
