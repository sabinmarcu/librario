# Design System

:::success
Any good design must be based on a system.
:::

I'm sure we can all agree to that. With that in mind, I started working on a few reusable components. For example, the omnipresent [`Button`](https://librario-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/docs/features-style-guide-button--showcase), or something as simple as a [`Surface`](https://librario-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/features-style-guide-surface--showcase) or [`Paper`](https://librario-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/features-style-guide-paper--showcase) component.

There's not much else to say here. It's a design system of delightful components. Check out the [Storybook](https://librario-storybook.vercel.app/) to see them in action.

PS. They're somewhat inspired by [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). For example, the `Button` comes with the `variant` and `color` props to vary its appearance.
