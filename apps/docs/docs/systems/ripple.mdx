# Ripple HOC

We all love the animation. How hard is it to code it, and how can it be integrated as a HOC to any component (well, any component that accepts `children`)

The answer? Not... extremely complicated. 

To be honest, I "borrowed" the code from an older project, done away with extra bits (like a HOC with a single ripple that resets on each click), and improved it.  

The original had a **HUGE** issue with click events not being picked up when attached with `onClick` from the parent component.

## Usage

It's a **HOC**. Take any component, and do this: 

```ts
const MyComponent = withRipple(...)
```

That's it. The HOC will take care of the rest.

:::warning Big Gotcha
Note that this will not work with components that don't accept `children`, like the `input` element, or any custom components that don't render their `children`.
