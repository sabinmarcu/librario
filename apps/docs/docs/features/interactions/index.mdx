# Applied Features

Once the logic and general small features are in place, we can start building the various big pieces to be assembled in the app. Like the [logic](../logic) section, I don't want to spend too much time explaining, since I do **not** want to influence someone's first glance at the implementation. I'll just briefly introduce each section, and be done with it.
