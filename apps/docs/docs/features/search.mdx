# Search

:::success
Global Search
:::

I envisioned a global search bar, that would be displayed in certain routes. I wanted the data from the search bar to be accessible everywhere, and be used to filter the data in any book lists.

## Usage

Plop the `Search` component somewhere in the app, and then use the `searchState` atom to query the input.


## Improvements

1. *Conditional render*. The naive approach would be some hook in the component rendering it, to decide on which route it should be displayed. Another, better option would be a Jotai state, and a simple component (or route wrapper) that would trigger visibility.
2. *Value reset*. Coupled with the conditional render, I'd like to wipe the state on route change.
