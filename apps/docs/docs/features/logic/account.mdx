# Accounts Feature

Since there are no requirements for data to be stored outside the app, and no specification for account/user operations, only that they could exist, I decided to hardcode a few. 

That's not to say I didn't build state around it. The way I planned it, is:

1. Several accounts are "created" on app start
2. Accounts can be "logged in" from a list of all accounts on a sidebar
3. Accounts and Current Account state is replicated to localStorage
4. Current Account data is available both through hooks and components for conditional rendering

Of course, I turned to `Jotai` again, to learn a new skill. User information is stored atomically (with `atomWithStorage` / `atom`), and combined into usable shape with `atomFamily` "selectors".

I created a list of users, along with the logic required, ready to be rendered in the app.

I also created a few `atom` selectors for use in conditional routing and a few components for conditional rendering.

## Usage

### Accounts List

```tsx
import { AcccountList } from '@librario/account'

export const Sidebar = () => (
  <header>
    [...]
    <AccountList [showStatus] />
    [...]
  </header>
)
```

### Conditional Render

```tsx
import { IfLoggedIn, IfUser } from '@librario/account'

export const Thing = () => (
  <div>

    <IfLoggedIn>
      <p>Logged in!</p>
    </IfLoggedIn>

    <IfUser>
      <p>I'm a regular user!</p>
    </IfUser>

  </div>
)

```

Or, if I need to do something other than "not render" when the condition isn't passing:

```tsx
import { isLoggedIn, isAdmin } from '@librario/account'

export const LoggedInRoute = () => {
  const loggedIn = useAtomValue(isLoggedIn)
  const admin = useAtomValue(isAdmin)

  if (!loggedIn) return <Redirect to="/login" />

  if (admin) return <AdminRoute />

  return <UserRoute />
}
```
