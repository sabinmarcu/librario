# Logic Features

These features will include most, if not all, of the business logic behind the app. The whole of the logic was built with Jotai atoms, and it was quite the journey of learning and trial and error. At the end of this journey, I do believe I could do a better job (or at least, take less time implementing something similar).

I won't talk too much about these, as I'd prefer to keep the focus on the code itself. If I explain too much, it might add or subtract from the impression one might get from reading the code.

I'll do a small intro in the [account](./account) section since it's the simplest, and the most hard-coded, and then briefly touch on the rest.
