# Searchable Book List

:::success
A fully searchable list of books
:::

This is a combination of the `BookList` component from the [Book Logic](./logic/book) feature, and the [Search](./search) feature. It... does exactly what you'd expect, receives a list of `ISBN`s and the data from the search bar, filters, and displays.

Like in the previous (and subsequent) section, I won't go too much into detail for this one. I will say that, while I'm not 100% sure I took the correct approach with the logic, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. 

:::danger
This is where I'd like to point out [My biggest regret](../overview#biggest-regret).
