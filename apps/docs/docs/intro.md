# Introduction

:::success Disclaimer
#### This is a passion project. Besides its obvious intended purpose, it was made for fun, and with a big emphasis on learning and discovering new ways to do things.
:::

I'm writing these lines to document "The Journey" of creating this project, from start to finish. It's both for myself, and for later reflection, as for any other person that might turn to this project for inspiration (either to learn from it or to avoid making some mistakes I made).

The process itself is loosely inspired by Devlog&trade; and built on `Docusaurus` since there's way less boilerplate involved. 

Overall, I will be discussing why I picked certain technologies (and why it took so long to set some of them up ðŸ˜…) as well as the motivation behind some of the decisions I made (such as building something from scratch).

I started building these docs once the rest of the setup was more or less done. That'll be included in the [setup section](./setup).

<!-- Also, I recommend starting with the [overview](./overview) section, as it will give you a better idea of how the project is set up. -->
